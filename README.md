# GNN-based simualtor for active matter physics (provisoire)

## Code for the simulating cell dynamics and finding mathematical formulation using symbolic regression

There are no satisfying mathematical formulation for the dynamics of cells yet. This is the subject of my master theiss. It is a two-step thesis:
  1) Simulate cell dynamics with a GNN using pytorch_geometric
  2)  Obtain mathematical expression using PySr
